I"†<p>If any of you have worked in an application that predates your employment at a large company, I think youâ€™ll be able to relate to me on this. You have no clue whatâ€™s going on, there are millions of repository and service layers, caching all over the place, and just general confusion. And I think it makes a lot of sense that the code is put together this way, it probably started out small, and simple, and through time all of those layers become bloated. The developer who originally created the application is long gone, and youâ€™re in charge of adding new features. The quickest way to do that is to just follow the same pattern.</p>
