I"J<p>Recently, I decided to put together a <a href="https://nicholas.fish/recipes/">silly little website</a> so that my wife could upload her recipes to the internet. I’m a big fan of using static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (the generator used to make this blog) because it allows you to upload new content without having to create new markup each time. For a technical person like me, it’s not problem writing a bit of yaml and markdown to get a page onto the internet for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Now, add your non-developer wife into the mix, and you’ll quickly learn that yaml isn’t fun for non-developers. This makes using Jekyll by itself an issue, because you have to name and format files in a very specific way, and that’s hard to keep track of. The way this would typically be handled is by storing user data in a database, and serving it up with a server of some sort. This approach is honestly great, and I’ve used it on a lot of projects in the past.</p>

<p>This one though, is a little different. I know that my wife and I are the only ones who will be modifying this data, and I also know that I want to host it for free. See where this is headed? Was the title enough of a clue?</p>

<p>These requirements basically pointed me straight to</p>
