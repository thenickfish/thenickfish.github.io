I"”<p>Recently, I decided to put together a silly little website so that my wife could upload her recipes to the internet. Iâ€™m a big fan of using static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (the generator used to make this blog) becuase it allows you to upload new content without having to create new markup each time. For a technical person like me, itâ€™s not problem writing a bit of yaml and markdown to get a page onto the internet for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Now, add your non-developer wife into the mix, and youâ€™ll quickly learn that yaml isnâ€™t fun for non-developers.</p>
