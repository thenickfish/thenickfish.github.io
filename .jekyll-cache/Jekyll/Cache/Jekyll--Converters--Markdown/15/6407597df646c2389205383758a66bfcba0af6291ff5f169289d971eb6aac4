I"±<p>This is an argument I heard in a discussion the other day, and I hadnâ€™t thought about it before. Is it true? Should I be moving everything into a batch job for efficiency reasons? For the particular problem we were discussing, it <em>may</em> be the most efficient way (from a time per record processed standpoint, at least). But is this always the case? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s so black and white, and Iâ€™ll explain below.</p>
