I"^<p>Recently, I decided to put together a silly little website so that my wife could upload her recipes to the internet. Iâ€™m a big fan of using static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (the generator used to make this blog) becuase it allows you to upload new content without having to create new markup each time.</p>
