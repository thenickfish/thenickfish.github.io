I'm a developer from Salt Lake City, UT. I love learning new things, and am constantly trying to improve my skills.

I'm passionate about software development, but also love spending time outdoors. I love to ride my mountain bike, climb, and camp as much as I can.

I work full time as a developer, but also do contract work. If you have a project and think I would be a good fit, I'd love to discuss it with you. You can contact me via [email](mailto:{{site.email}}), or tag me (@{{site.github_username}}) in your github issue.
